// Test 3: How the fixes work
echo "\n3. 🔧 How the Fixes Work:\n";
echo "  A. Job Cancellation Flow:\n";
echo "    1. User clicks Cancel button\n";
echo "    2. cancelCrawl() method called\n";
echo "    3. Job deleted from queue (if not yet processed)\n";
echo "    4. Story status set to NOT_CRAWLED\n";
echo "    5. crawl_job_id cleared\n";
echo "    6. Running job checks shouldCancel() periodically\n";
echo "    7. Job exits gracefully when cancelled\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  B. Remove from Queue Flow:\n";
echo "    1. User clicks Remove from Queue\n";
echo "    2. removeFromQueue() method called\n";
echo "    3. All jobs for story deleted from queue\n";
echo "    4. Story status reset to NOT_CRAWLED\n";
echo "    5. crawl_job_id cleared\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  C. Job Self-Cancellation:\n";
echo "    1. Job calls shouldCancel() before/during execution\n";
echo "    2. Checks if story status is still CRAWLING\n";
echo "    3. Checks if crawl_job_id matches current job\n";
echo "    4. Exits if cancellation detected\n";

// Test 4: Testing scenarios
echo "\n4. 🧪 Testing Scenarios:\n";
echo "  Scenario A - Cancel job in queue:\n";
echo "    1. Start crawl job\n";
echo "    2. Immediately click Cancel (before processing starts)\n";
echo "    3. Expected: Job removed from queue, no crawling occurs\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  Scenario B - Cancel job while processing:\n";
echo "    1. Start crawl job\n";
echo "    2. Wait for processing to start\n";
echo "    3. Click Cancel during processing\n";
echo "    4. Expected: Job detects cancellation and stops\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  Scenario C - Remove from queue:\n";
echo "    1. Start multiple crawl jobs\n";
echo "    2. Click Remove from Queue\n";
echo "    3. Expected: All jobs removed, no processing occurs\n";

// Test 5: Limitations and workarounds
echo "\n5. ⚠️ Current Limitations:\n";
echo "  A. External Process Issue:\n";
echo "    - CrawlStoryJob calls 'crawl:stories' command\n";
echo "    - Command executes 'node crawl.mjs' via exec()\n";
echo "    - External Node.js process may continue running\n";
echo "    - Solution: Implement process monitoring and termination\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  B. Timing Issues:\n";
echo "    - Job may start processing before cancellation\n";
echo "    - Short delay between queue removal and process start\n";
echo "    - Solution: shouldCancel() checks during execution\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  C. Process Cleanup:\n";
echo "    - Node.js processes may remain running\n";
echo "    - Need manual process termination\n";
echo "    - Solution: Monitor and kill orphaned processes\n";

// Test 6: Monitoring and debugging
echo "\n6. 🔍 Monitoring and Debugging:\n";
echo "  A. Check Laravel logs:\n";
echo "    tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log\n";
echo "    Look for: 'Job cancelled:', 'Starting crawl job', 'Deleted crawl job'\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  B. Check running processes:\n";
echo "    Windows: tasklist | findstr php\n";
echo "    Windows: tasklist | findstr node\n";
echo "    Linux: ps aux | grep php\n";
echo "    Linux: ps aux | grep node\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  C. Check queue status:\n";
echo "    php artisan queue:work --once (process one job)\n";
echo "    php artisan queue:clear (clear all jobs)\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  D. Reset stuck stories:\n";
echo "    UPDATE stories SET crawl_status = 0, crawl_job_id = NULL WHERE crawl_status = 3;\n";

// Test 7: Success criteria
echo "\n7. ✅ Success Criteria:\n";
echo "  Cancel Crawl Success:\n";
echo "    ✅ Button click returns success message\n";
echo "    ✅ Story status changes to NOT_CRAWLED\n";
echo "    ✅ crawl_job_id is cleared\n";
echo "    ✅ No new chapters are crawled\n";
echo "    ✅ Logs show cancellation messages\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  Remove from Queue Success:\n";
echo "    ✅ Button click returns success message\n";
echo "    ✅ Jobs removed from queue\n";
echo "    ✅ Story status reset\n";
echo "    ✅ No processing occurs\n";

// Test 8: Next steps for complete solution
echo "\n8. 🚀 Next Steps for Complete Solution:\n";
echo "  A. Process Monitoring (Advanced):\n";
echo "    - Track Node.js process IDs\n";
echo "    - Implement process termination\n";
echo "    - Add timeout mechanisms\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  B. Signal Handling (crawl.mjs):\n";
echo "    - Add SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers\n";
echo "    - Check cancellation flags\n";
echo "    - Graceful shutdown\n";
echo "  \n";
echo "  C. Queue Worker Management:\n";
echo "    - Monitor queue worker health\n";
echo "    - Implement worker restart mechanisms\n";
echo "    - Add job timeout handling\n";
